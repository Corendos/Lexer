# Lexer

## Description
This is a repository containing my implementation of a lexer, based on the following lecture:
[Basics of Compiler Design](http://hjemmesider.diku.dk/~torbenm/Basics/basics_lulu2.pdf)

## Todo
[x] NFA to DFA transformation  
[~] Detecting tokens  
[ ] Write documentation
[ ] Report lexical errors instead of terminating the program  
[ ] Use a better structure to represent token types  
[ ] Add more infos to the tokens payload  
[ ] Clean the code  
[ ] (Not really related) Write the complete set of tokens for the test language  
[ ] Graph optimization
